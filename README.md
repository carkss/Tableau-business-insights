# Tableau-business-insights

This project involves exploring a simulated real-world business dataset using Tableau to uncover, visualise, and communicate commercially relevant insights to a simulated senior management audience. A Tableau story (a collection of dashboards) and an accompanying max 1500 words written report summarising key findings and business recommendations will be included. Additionally, 

NOTE:  The dataset was provided for academic purposes and is not publicly available, therefore it will not be uploaded to this repository. Additionally, the following overview offers only a short summary. For more detailed insights and visualisations, please refer to either the Tableau story or the written report. 

## Structure of report 

1. Executive summary

2. Introduction

3. Insights from Tableau stories:

3.1: Dashboard 1: Regional and oOrder Priority-Based Profit Analysis:

This dashboard explores how region and order priority impact annual profits. Initial analysis shows that the Central region consistently gross the highest profits across all years. However, digging deeper into the order priority breakdown, especially the dominant Medium-priority orders reveals a different story.

By analysing profits into discounts, sales, and profits, and customer counts together, a clear insight emerges: Interestingly, an increase in discounts correlates with a decline in profits, even as customer count and sales rise. This suggests that discounting strategies may be undermining the region’s potential, despite strong sales volume.

The takeaway: While Central is the leading force of profits on paper, hidden inefficiencies in pricing strategy point to an opportunity for more profit optimisation.

3.2: Dashboard 2: States and their Shipping Costs: 

This dashboard focuses on shipping cost patterns across U.S. states, with California standing out due to high variability across shipping modes.

A closer look at California's data reveals that Standard Class has the highest number of distinct customers, making it the most representative shipping mode. 

By delving into seasonal trends, an insight can be made: lowest shipping costs occur in February, likely tied to promotional periods while October and December see peak costs possible due to increased holiday demands.

The takeaway: There is a clear and strong relationship between customer counts and shipping costs.

3.3: Dashboard 3: Categories Forcasted Profits

This dashboard explores profit trends across product categories and forecasts their future performance. Technology consistently shows the strongest growth, while Furniture lags behind. A deeper look into sub-categories confirms a positive profit trend for most, though Tables continue to incur losses. Forecasting reveals that even Technology’s worst-performing sub-category outprofits others, reinforcing its lead.

Key takeaway: Technology is the most promising category in terms of sustained profitability, while Furniture presents ongoing risk due to underperforming sub-categories like Tables.

3.4: Dashboard 4: Country’s Sub-Categories’ Factors Relating to Profit

This dashboard focuses on country-level profitability, with Turkey highlighted for its significant losses. A breakdown of key factors reveals that while discounts do increase customer count, neither strongly impacts profits. Instead, shipping costs show a more direct link to the magnitude of losses as when shipping costs rise, so do losses.

Key takeaway: Shipping costs are the dominant factor behind Turkey’s declining profits, outweighing the effects of discounts or customer volume.


3.5: Dashboard 5: Customer Loyalty

This dashboard explores the customer purchasing behavior. Most customers tend to place between 4–9 orders, with very few exceeding 25. A deeper look at quarterly returning rates reveals consistent growth in repeat purchases over the years, with Q1 consistently having the lowest rate.

Key takeaway: Customer loyalty has steadily increased, as evidenced by rising quarterly and yearly returning rates highlighting a strengthening relationship between the company and its customer base over time.

4. Recommendations based on each dashboard: The main recommendations are to
- Dashbaord1: Segment customer by financial capacity to prevent excessive discounts for higher income groups 
- Dashboard 2 and 4: Alternative shipping and optimising shipping volumes based on state-level and seasonal patterns.
- Dashboard 3: Perform a market basket analysis to identity commonly purchased product combinations and strategically promote complementary items to boost category-level profits.
- Dashboard 5: Introduce loyalty programs or cashback incentives to strengthen customer retention and reward repeat purchases.
